"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"

# Update vite.config.js:
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/egain-easy-insight/',  // Your repo name
  plugins: [react()],
  // ... rest of config
})

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

URL: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/egain-easy-insight

  npm run build

□ Test production build locally:
  npm run preview

□ Verify .gitignore excludes code_md/:
  cat .gitignore | grep code_md

□ Check README.md is complete:
  cat README.md

□ Run linter:
  npm run lint

□ Optional - Run tests:
  npm run test

## COST BREAKDOWN (ALL FREE!)

| Service       | Cost  | Bandwidth | Build Minutes |
